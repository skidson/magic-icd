The Interactive Community Displays projects aims to provide end-users with intuitive mobile and public-display social applications that connect the social web with real life activities. By leveraging social media, geolocation, pervasive sensors, augmented reality and architectural displays visitors of Third Places (e.g. coffee shops, bars, pubs) can feel connected to the local community they interact with every day. The goal of this project is to create a coffee shop suite that gathers and publishes private and public data generated in public settings. Data will be collected from sensors, web interfaces and online social networks. Your job will be to create a mobile application to sense and visualize such information. Data is managed by our server's REST API.
